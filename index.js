Unexpected Awesome Person:

The title of this page puts it very well. This is not about a specific role, but about you as a character! Even though we are only actively looking for people to join our engineering team right now, this does not mean that we don't need other roles to assemble a rockstar formation to change the brokerage industry. In the next months we will be looking for a couple of profiles joining us, so we are more than happy to get to know you as early as possible and see if we can bring you in. It does not matter if you are experienced in Marketing, Data Engineering, Business Development, Business Intelligence, Brokerage, Legal & Compliance or want to help us to support our developer community with unique content. We would love to hear from you!
